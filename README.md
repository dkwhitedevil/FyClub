### What Makes FY Club Perfect for This Hackathon

✅ Built entirely with **ADK-TS** (Agent Development Kit – TypeScript)       
✅ Multi-agent AI system for autonomous decision-making             
✅ Deployed on **ATP** (Agent Tokenization Platform)            
✅ On-chain security agent with real-world DeFi impact           
✅ Production-ready monorepo architecture         
✅ Fully open-source and transparent

## 🎯 The Problem

Decentralized Finance has unlocked trillion-dollar opportunities—but it has also created one of the most dangerous financial environments ever built.

Today, DeFi users, DAOs, and treasuries face:

- ❌ Rug pulls
- ❌ Smart contract exploits
- ❌ Overexposure to a single asset
- ❌ Liquidity collapses
- ❌ Human delay in risk response
- ❌ No real-time defensive AI layer

Most security systems in DeFi are:

- **Reactive** → they respond *after* funds are lost
- **Manual** → humans must interpret dashboards
- **Slow** → attacks happen in seconds

### ⚠️ The Truth

> In DeFi, **by the time you "notice" risk, it is already too late.**

---

## ✅ The Solution

**FY Club is an AI-powered on-chain security agent that acts as a real-time defensive layer for DeFi treasuries.**

Instead of waiting for damage, FY Club:

✅ Continuously monitors treasury activity
✅ Analyzes DeFi exposure using AI agents
✅ Detects financial and protocol-level risk
✅ Predicts dangerous concentration patterns
✅ Generates real-time protective actions
✅ Acts as a **digital bodyguard for DeFi funds**

> **FY Club doesn't react to loss. It prevents loss.**

---

## 🚀 How It Works (In 3 Steps)

Users just:

1. **Enter** their treasury address
2. **Click** "Scan"
3. **Instantly get**:
   - Risk score
   - Exposure breakdown
   - AI-generated protection advice

### Example Output:

```
❗ "Your treasury is 78% exposed to one asset."
❗ "Liquidity risk detected."
✅ "Diversification recommended."
✅ "Reduce exposure to prevent cascade failure."
```

## 📊 Architecture Overview

```
User → Web Dashboard → API → AI Agents → Risk Analysis → Protection Advice → User
```

### Core Components:

| Component      | Technology      | Role                          |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Web**        | Next.js + React | User interface & dashboard    |
| **API**        | Fastify + TS    | Backend server & orchestrator |
| **Agents**     | ADK-TS          | AI decision-making engine     |
| **Tools**      | RPC/DeFi APIs   | Blockchain & protocol access  |
| **Policies**   | Config files    | Risk management rules         |

## 🤖 AI Agent System

FY Club runs a **multi-agent AI system** where each agent is specialized and autonomous:

| AI Agent             | Role                              |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Watcher Agent**    | Reads treasury & asset balances   |
| **Risk Agent**       | Calculates exposure & danger      |
| **Planner Agent**    | Generates safety actions          |
| **Governance Agent** | Enforces policy constraints       |

### How They Work Together:

1. **Watcher** → Fetches treasury data from blockchain
2. **Risk Agent** → Analyzes exposure & detects patterns
3. **Planner** → Generates protection recommendations
4. **Governance** → Validates against user policies

---

## 🧠 Built with ADK-TS

FY Club is **fully implemented using IQAI's Agent Development Kit for TypeScript (ADK-TS)**, the industry standard for building autonomous AI agents on blockchain.

### ADK-TS Implementation

Our four specialized agents are built using `AgentBuilder` pattern:

```typescript
// Example: Risk Analysis Agent using ADK-TS
import { AgentBuilder } from "@iqai/adk";

export async function initRiskAgent() {
  return await AgentBuilder.create("risk_analysis_agent")
    .withModel("qwen2.5")
    .withInstruction("Analyze treasury concentration and financial risk...")
    .build();
}
```

### Agent Architecture

Each agent follows the ADK-TS pattern:

**1. Watcher Agent** – Real-time Treasury Monitor
```typescript
import { AgentBuilder } from "@iqai/adk";
// Fetches on-chain data using RPC calls
// Validates treasury balances and positions
// Returns structured TreasurySnapshot
```

**2. Risk Agent** – Autonomous Risk Analyzer
```typescript
// Uses ADK-TS AgentBuilder for LLM decision-making
// Analyzes concentration, diversification, and size risk
// Generates risk scores with deterministic fallbacks
// Returns RiskResult with level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
```

**3. Planner Agent** – Protection Strategy Generator
```typescript
// Generates mitigation actions based on risk assessment
// Returns structured ProtectionPlan with action types:
// - ALERT: Notify operators
// - REDUCE: Lower exposure
// - DIVERSIFY: Add assets
```

**4. Governance Agent** – Policy Enforcer
```typescript
// Final safety decision-maker
// Enforces hard rules: HIGH risk + large treasury = BLOCKED
// Uses ADK-TS LLM with deterministic fallbacks
// Returns GovernanceDecision with approval/block reasoning
```

### LLM Integration with ADK-TS

FY Club uses a **LLM + Deterministic Fallback Pattern**:

```typescript
// ADK Agent calls LLM (Qwen model)
const llmResponse = await callQwenLLM(prompt);

// Robust JSON extraction from LLM response
const parsed = extractJSON<RiskResult>(llmResponse);

// Validates structure and types
if (validated) {
  return llmResult;
}

// Falls back to deterministic logic if LLM response malformed
return treasuryTools.generateBaseRisk(snapshot);
```

### Tools & Capabilities

ADK-TS agents leverage custom tools:

```typescript
export const treasuryTools = {
  analyzeConcentration: (snapshot) => {...},
  analyzeSizeExposure: (totalValue) => {...},
  generateBaseRisk: (snapshot) => {...}
};
```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration Workflow

All agents are orchestrated in a **sequential decision pipeline** using ADK-TS:

```typescript
export async function runTreasuryWorkflow(address: string) {
  // 1. Initialize all ADK agents
  await initRiskAgent();
  await initPlannerAgent();
  await initGovernanceAgent();

  // 2. Run sequential pipeline
  const snapshot = await watchTreasury(address);        // Watcher
  const risk = await analyzeRisk(snapshot);             // Risk Agent (ADK)
  const plan = await generateProtectionPlan(risk);      // Planner Agent (ADK)
  const governance = await enforceGovernance({...});    // Governance Agent (ADK)

  return { snapshot, risk, plan, governance };
}
```

### Why ADK-TS?

- ✅ **Native TypeScript support** – Full type safety across agent ecosystem
- ✅ **AgentBuilder pattern** – Declarative, composable agent definitions
- ✅ **LLM flexibility** – Supports Gemini, GPT-4, Claude, custom models
- ✅ **Production-ready** – Error handling, timeouts, retries built-in
- ✅ **ATP compatible** – Agents launch directly on IQAI's ATP platform
- ✅ **Deterministic fallbacks** – Never fails completely, always returns valid decisions
- ✅ **Tool integration** – Seamless blockchain and external API access

### Deployment Ready

FY Club's ADK-TS agents are ready for **ATP (Agent Tokenization Platform)** deployment, where they will operate as autonomous, tokenized agents on IQAI's infrastructure.
